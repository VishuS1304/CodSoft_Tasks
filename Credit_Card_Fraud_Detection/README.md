# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection repository! This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraudulent activities in credit card transactions pose a significant challenge for financial institutions and customers alike. Detecting and preventing these fraudulent transactions is essential to ensure the security of financial systems and protect users from monetary losses.

## Introduction

Credit card fraud detection involves the use of machine learning techniques to identify transactions that are likely to be fraudulent. This repository houses a project dedicated to creating an effective predictive model that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing transaction patterns and features, we aim to develop a model that can help financial institutions and users prevent fraudulent activities.

## Dataset

Our credit card fraud detection model relies on a carefully curated **credit card transaction dataset**. This dataset contains features such as transaction amount, transaction timestamp, merchant information, and more. The dataset also includes a binary label indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. It's important to note that due to privacy and security concerns, the dataset is often anonymized.

## Methodology

Our approach to Credit Card Fraud Detection can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features might be normalized or standardized. Anonymized features are retained to protect user privacy.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We analyze the distribution of features and visualize patterns in both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. EDA helps identify potential correlations and outliers.

3. **Feature Engineering**: New features might be derived from existing ones, and specific features that contribute significantly to fraud detection are selected.

4. **Model Selection**: We experiment with various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

5. **Training and Validation**: The dataset is split into training and validation sets to train the selected model. Hyperparameters are tuned to optimize performance.

6. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices. Due to class imbalance, metrics like recall are crucial.

7. **Prediction**: The trained model is used to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent based on its features.
