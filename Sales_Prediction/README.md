## Introduction

Sales prediction plays a crucial role in the success of any business. This repository hosts a project dedicated to building a machine learning model that can forecast future sales based on historical sales data and potentially other influencing factors. By leveraging predictive analytics, businesses can anticipate demand, optimize inventory, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

## Dataset

The foundation of our sales prediction model is a comprehensive **sales dataset**. This dataset contains historical sales data, including features such as time period (date or month), product information, marketing expenditure, competitor data, and more. These features contribute to understanding sales patterns and trends over time.

## Methodology

Our approach to Project Sales Prediction involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming features as required. Time-based features might need special treatment.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights into sales trends, seasonality, and potential correlations between sales and influencing factors.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, such as moving averages, lag features, and categorical encodings, to capture relevant information.

4. **Model Selection**: Exploring various time series forecasting models, such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or advanced machine learning models like Gradient Boosting or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

5. **Training and Validation**: Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, training the selected model, and fine-tuning hyperparameters.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics appropriate for time series data, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

7. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model can predict future sales based on new input data, allowing businesses to plan accordingly.
