## Introduction

Iris flower classification is a fundamental problem in the realm of machine learning and pattern recognition. This repository hosts a project that aims to create a predictive model capable of accurately classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their morphological features. By undertaking this project, we provide an opportunity for learning about data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation in the context of a classification task.

## Dataset

The dataset employed for this project is the famous **Iris dataset**. It contains samples from three species of Iris flowers: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. Each sample consists of four features:

- Sepal Length (in cm)
- Sepal Width (in cm)
- Petal Length (in cm)
- Petal Width (in cm)

The goal is to train a machine learning model to accurately predict the species of Iris flower based on these four features.

## Methodology

Our approach to the Iris flower classification task encompasses the following stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, checked for missing values, and prepared for analysis. Numerical features are often scaled to ensure that they have similar ranges.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We visualize the dataset to gain insights into feature distributions, relationships, and potential outliers. EDA helps in understanding the characteristics of the dataset.

3. **Feature Selection**: By analyzing correlations and the importance of features, we identify the most relevant ones for classification.

4. **Model Selection**: Several classification algorithms are explored, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Each algorithm's strengths and weaknesses are considered.

5. **Training and Validation**: The dataset is split into training and validation subsets. The selected model(s) are trained on the training data and validated on the validation data.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

7. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model is ready to predict the species of Iris flowers based on new data.
