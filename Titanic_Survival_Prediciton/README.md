## Introduction

The Titanic's sinking in 1912 remains a tragic event, and this project aims to create a predictive model that can estimate passenger survival based on attributes such as age, gender, class, and more. This repository showcases a machine learning approach to understanding survival patterns and exploring the factors that influenced the outcomes of different passengers.

## Dataset

Our Titanic Survival Prediction model relies on the **Titanic dataset**, which contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, and whether a passenger survived or not. This dataset is widely used in the machine learning community as a classic example for binary classification problems.

## Methodology

Our approach to Titanic Survival Prediction involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights into survival rates based on different features, visualizing passenger distributions, and analyzing correlations.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that might provide insights, such as family size or title derived from passenger names.

4. **Model Selection**: Exploring various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks.

5. **Training and Validation**: Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, training the selected model, and optimizing hyperparameters.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.

7. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model can predict whether a passenger would have survived based on their attributes.
